This script enhances your Single Player Tarkov (SPT-AKI) server by sending real-time raid information to your Discord server via webhooks. Get automatic notifications for raid starts and a live feed of boss kills.

Please note that this is an early iteration. Suggestions and bug reports are welcome!

‚ùó Prerequisites
Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

An installed and working SPT-Fika server.

Boss Notifier Mod: This mod is required for the Boss Kill Feed to function correctly.

Download Link: https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1737-boss-notifier

A Discord server where you have permissions to create and manage webhooks.

Two separate text channels in your Discord server: one for general raid notifications and one for the boss kill feed.

üîß Installation and Configuration

Step 1: Install the Required Mod
Download the Boss Notifier mod from the link above and install it according to its instructions (typically by extracting it into your user/mods/ directory).

Step 2: Copy Script Files
Copy the contents of this folder into your SPT server's root directory.

Step 3: Configure Your Webhooks

In your Discord server, create a webhook for your raid notifications channel and a second webhook for your boss kill feed channel.

Open the raid_dashboard.js file in a text editor (like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++).

Find the lines that define the webhook URLs:

// Paste your Discord webhook URLs here
const RAID_WEBHOOK_URL = 'YOUR_RAID_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE';

const BOSS_KILL_WEBHOOK_URL = 'YOUR_BOSS_KILL_FEED_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE';


Replace the placeholder text with your actual webhook URLs. Make sure to keep the single quotes ' ' around each URL.

üöÄ Usage
After completing the installation and configuration, run the included batch file. The script will start alongside your SPT server and automatically send raid information to your configured Discord channels.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations
This script currently requires a headless client to run. A version that can operate without one has not yet been developed.

As an early version, you may encounter bugs.

ü§î Troubleshooting
No notifications are being sent: Double-check that your webhook URLs are correctly pasted into the raid_dashboard.js file. Verify there are no typos and that the URLs are enclosed in single quotes.

Boss kill notifications are missing: Ensure you have correctly installed the mandatory Boss Notifier mod in your user/mods/ folder.
